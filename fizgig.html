       <h1>Fizgig</h1>
        <p>Fizgig is Fonseca’s national card game, and one of its cultural hallmarks. Many have spoken of Fizgig’s prominence in Fonsecan culture. Ekene Cerridwens famously said Fizgig “captures everything about Fonseca and its inhabitants: their cultural diversity, intricate worldviews, and zest for life”. </p>

        <h2>Details</h2> 

        <p>The game is played with a deck of 120 cards, consisting of 4 suits (air, earth, water, and fire) of 30 cards each, numbered 0 to 29. 30 is an important number in Lloereg culture, as it is the approximate number of days in a month, and the Sun and Moon are the two premier figures in their mythology and cosmology. </p>

        <p>The game begins with one card being drawn onto the <i>world’s hand</i> in the middle of the table and the rest placed face down in a pile close by. Play progresses around the table, with each player doing one action on their turn. They can: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>Get:</i></b> Draw one card from the pile into their hand.</li>
            <li><b><i>Share:</i></b> Place one card from their hand into the world’s hand.</li>
            <li><b><i>Seek:</i></b> Place one card from the pile into the world’s hand. This also happens if everyone’s most recent action was to wait.</li>
            <li><b><i>Wait:</i></b> Do nothing.</li>
            <li><b><i>Face:</i></b> Begin the face-off. When a person faces, they usually believe they have the best hand.</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>During the face-off, players can get, share, seek, and wait as usual. When play has passed back to the person who initiated the face-off, everyone reveals their hands. The person with the most points wins. </p>

        <p>Point scoring in Fizgig works differently from most other games. Firstly, points are tallied from cards in your hand <em>and the world’s hand</em>. This is usually a benefit, although not always. The remainder of the rules of scoring vary widely between players. Some of the many ways to score or lose points that have been attested include: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Having multiple cards of the same number</li>
            <li>Having multiple cards of the same suit</li>
            <li>Having a full set of elements (earth, air, water, and fire)</li>
            <li>Having cards with higher numbers</li>
            <li>Having cards with numbers in sequence</li>
            <li>Having no cards of the same number</li>
            <li>Having all cards of the same suit</li> 
            <li>Having all cards of different numbers or suits than the world’s hand</li>
            <li>Having cards of “interesting” numbers (e.g. squares, primes, divisible by 7)</li> 
        </ul>
        
        <p>Ultimately, no matter how you score, the player with the most points wins. If a tie occurs, tied players draw a card into their hand and compare scores again.</p>
        
        <p>When playing for cash, whoever faces bets a certain amount of money into the pot. Each player, along with playing normally, also will either:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>Sit:</i></b> Bet no money to the pot. If you win, the pot is not given to you. </li>
            <li><b><i>Match:</i></b> Bet the amount previously betted into the pot.</li>
            <li><b><i>Raise:</i></b> Bet a greater amount than was previously betted into the pot.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whoever wins (if they did not sit) gets the entire bet. </p>

        <h2>Origins, History, and Etymology</h2>

        <p>Fizgig originated as a fusion of European card games and the traditional Lloereg game of Dwil. Its wide variety of point-scoring mechanics meant it caught on with players of all skill levels. It was first described in writing by John Ainsworth Jr. in his booklet <i>Fizz-Gig, a Game Played Among the Inhabitants of the Island of Fonseca: A Description and Guide.</i> The game was also a symbol of racial unity, as while it was played among slaveholders it was also played discreetly among the enslaved. </p>

        <p>As Fonseca became a hotspot for various disreputable activities, including gambling, Fizgig became even more prominent. Part of its popularity is that it was difficult to adapt into the traditional house-player dichotomy common in casinos. Thus, it became a symbol of gambling remaining a social activity. </p>

        <p>In the decades after the Fonsecan Revolution, Fizgig became became something of a secular icon. In 1977 it was officially named the national game of Fonseca. It has become popular across the Federation of Phantom Islands, so much so that often the national tournament has more non-Fonsecan players than Fonsecan players. </p>

        <p>The name of the game, “fizgig”, has numerous meanings and five independent etymologies. This means it is hard to determine the initial meaning of the name. Theories include: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>“Fizgig” is used to mean gallivanting, as in Fizgig there is an incentive to draw many, many cards.</li>
            <li>“Fizgig” is used to mean a small firework, as a reference to the bombastic nature of the game.</li>
            <li>“Fizgig” is used to mean a harpoon as a reference to the competitive nature of the game.</li>
            <li>“Fizgig” is used to mean an entrapper, as one of the common uses of sharing is to lull people into believing they have an unbeatable hand.</li> 
            <li>“Fizgig” is used to mean Jacobaea vulgaris, as its status as both a toxin for horses and a source of nectar parallels that drawing a card could have a positive or negative effect.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The name being the same as The Dark Crystal character Fizzgig is coincidental.</p>
